-- 실데이터 검증 중 발견: decline_program(자기 평균 대비 -30% 이상 하락)이 매일 거의 모든
-- 채널에서 새벽 시간대 필러 프로그램(예: 최근 12주 평균 0.009~0.026 수준)이 오늘 0.000을
-- 기록한 것만 잡아내고 있었다 — 이런 새벽 저시청률 슬롯은 표본이 작아 0.000이 매우 흔해서
-- "-100% 하락"이 통계적 노이즈일 뿐 실제로 코멘트할 가치가 있는 "엄청난 하락"이 아니다.
-- baseline_avg >= 0.05(웬만한 낮 시간대 프로그램 수준) 조건을 추가해 의미 있는 규모의 프로그램만
-- 잡히도록 한다.
